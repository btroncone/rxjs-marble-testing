#RxJS Minimal Marble Testing Setup w/ WallabyJS

Minimal setup to start utilizing marble testing.

### Getting Started

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/btroncone/rxjs-marble-testing.git

# run install
npm install
```

Once complete, select the *wallaby.js* configuration file and run. For help running in your favorite editor,
check out the [official documentation](https://wallabyjs.com/docs/index.html).

By default, specs are meant to go in the `specs` folder with other relevant files under the `src` directory.
This can be configured in the *wallaby.js* file.

### What about Karma?
I will likely be adding a karma config soon or would gladly accept a pull request!
